## About the Project

The Edutainment app, developed as part of Day 35's challenge in the "100 Days with SwiftUI" course, is a SwiftUI-based educational app for children. It combines learning with fun, focusing on engagingly practicing multiplication tables.

### Features

- **Customizable Difficulty:** Allows selection of multiplication tables ranging from 2 to 12.
- **Question Count Options:** Users can choose to be asked 5, 10, or 20 questions.
- **Dynamic Questions:** Questions are generated randomly within the chosen difficulty range.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Incorporates user-friendly elements like steppers, pickers, and buttons.

### Learning Journey

This app showcases the progress and skills acquired by Day 35 of the course. Key learnings implemented in this project include:
- Managing app state for game settings and flow.
- Using structs to structure question data.
- Building SwiftUI views for a user-friendly interface.
- Utilizing closures for data transfer between views.
